# Stub project

This project contains the stub files for your project.

# IMPORTANT
**You MUST fork this project into your remote repository BEFORE cloning it to your local disc space.**




Note that the Tests file contains two example tests - these tests will produce incorrect output if run without editing JobManager.java.

If run without edits you should get:

Thread-9: started & calling serverLogin(ComputeServer, ID=4)
Thread-9: server_type=ComputeServer, job=, ID=4 -- released by jobManager.
main: threads started, now specifying job1.
main: calling specifyJob(jobName=job01, job={ComputeServer=2})
main: expect two ComputeServers 'job01' [ID=3&4] to be released:
main: job1 specified, now specifying job2.
main: calling specifyJob(jobName=job02, job={ComputeServer=2})
main: expect two ComputeServers 'job02' [ID=1&2] to be released:
```
the above is not correct as all server threads have been immediately released.
